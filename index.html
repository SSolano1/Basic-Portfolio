            <p> Hi!  My name is Solon Solano, I am a father, a workout warrior (at least I used to be), and a full stack developer.  My goal is to learn and share the most important concepts of coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel very luck to share my work with a wide range of people.  So in case you would like to find out more about my work, or would like to discuss them personally, you are welcome to contact me.
            </p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
