            <p> Hi!  My name is Solon Solano, I am a father, a workout warrior (at least I used to be), and a full stack developer.  My goal is to learn and share the most important concepts of coding.</p>

            <p>I believe that your best life imaginable is waiting for you, so work hard and claim it!</p>

            <p>I feel very luck to share my work with a wide range of people.  So in case you would like to find out more about my work, or would like to discuss them personally, you are welcome to contact me.</p>
