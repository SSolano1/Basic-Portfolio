            <p> Hi!  My name is Solon Solano, I am a father, workout warrior (at least I used to be), and a full stack developer.  My goal is to Learn and share the most important concepts of coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel very luck to share my work with a wide range of people.  So in case you would like to find out more about my work, or would like to discuss them personally, you are welcome to contact me.
